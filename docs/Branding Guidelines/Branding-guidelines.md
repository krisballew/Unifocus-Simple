> **Source:** _Brand_Guidelines (2).pdf_ (text-only extraction)

## Brand usage
This document outlines how Unifocus presents itself when communicating with the world.

## Brand voice
As part of a fun, fresh, and innovative initiative, Unifocus modernized its company name and uses a lower case **"f"** in **Unifocus** going forward.

## Photography
Unifocus’ photography style is both technology- and people-focused. Depict staff in the hospitality industry and individuals using smart phones and tablets; photography should feel approachable and relatable to the target audience. Cut-out images can be used when the subject is using technology. Avoid surrounding content that obstructs the subject in the frame.

## Iconography
The Unifocus icon library uses simplified line illustrations showcased in **two colors** to create visual interest. When placed on a dark background, the icon may be paired with a **gradient hexagon** for depth while remaining clean and clear. Choose between light or dark icon sets based on greatest legibility.

## Brand elements

### Dark mode
Brand elements can be showcased in dark mode by using the darker hues of the color palette. This creates richness and contrast against other brand elements such as photography and icons.

### Light mode
Brand elements can be showcased in light mode by using the lighter hues in the color palette. This creates a more airy, light feel while remaining modern, sleek, and innovative. Use the color mode that best suits the medium and platform where content will be displayed.

### Pattern
A **hexagon pattern** can be used at lower opacity behind content to add dimension and movement.

### Illustration
Use illustrations to communicate product features and platform capabilities simply and straightforwardly. These illustrations may include more detail and color than icon sets, but should never use more than **two to three** colors from the color palette.
